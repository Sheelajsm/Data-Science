1) What is closure in python?
Python Closures are inner functions that are enclosed within the outer function. 
Closures can access variables present in the outer function scope. 
It can access these variables even after the outer function has completed its execution.


What is Class in python
A class is a user -defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.

How to instantiate a class in Python?
To instantiate a class, we call the class as if it were a function, passing the arguments 
that the __init__ method defines. The return value will be the newly created object.

What is self in Python?
 self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self” we can access the attributes 
 and methods of the class in python.
 
What is the __init__ method?
__init__ is a constructor.when an object is created from a class,it allows the class to 
initialize the attributes of the class.

How do you implement inheritance in Python?
We first create a parent class then Create  another class which is child class.create object for 
parent class and create a object in child class.It has all features of parent class,we have 
inheriting the property of parent class in child class.

How to access parent class inside child class in Python?
 call the constructor of parent class inside the constructor of child class and then the object
 of a child class can access the methods and attributes of the parent class.
 Syntax : class childclass_name (parentclass_name)

What is super()
super() function that will make the child class inherit all the methods and properties 
from its parent
